# WordpressAndroid

The WordpressAndroid project is an Android project that get it feeds from WordPress Database installed on your server and displays it
on the app for users to view. For this App to work, you need to download the simple endpoints i wrote just for this app, because i decided not to
use the official Wordpress API/Endpoints for this project.

So, you can get the simple Wordpress API i wrote from this app via this link https://github.com/utiegbai/WordpressSimpleAPIForAndroid, then create a subdomain on your web server
and upload the codes there and configure the database connection settings with yours, located in *classes/class.db.php* file.

Next: Download this project and import with your Android Studio, and locate this Java file inside *utility->api->ApiUrl*, then change the host variable to your own API url, and compile the app
You can change the layout, colors, icons, themes, etc
